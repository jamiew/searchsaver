Searchsaver
----

This utility grabs all of your Twitter saved searches, downloads the results,
and then runs every N minutes to grab new search results. Searchsaver: saves searches.

Twitter currently doesn't display search results older than just a few days, 
which is a shame when you're looking for an old tweet or are interested in 
measuring results over time.

Each search result set's JSON is saved to disk in its entirety for simplicity (no sqlite etc)
This means you'll need to read them all and merge by hand come processing-time


Dependencies
------------

  sudo gem install mechanize json cgi


Configuration
-------------

1. copy config.sample.yml to config.yml and edit
2. ruby archive.rb
3. enjoy your tweets!


Usage
-----

Run forever, downloading every N seconds: 

  ruby archive.rb

Run once (e.g. via cron): 

  LOOP=0 ruby archive.rb
