Searchsaver
----

This utility grabs all your saved searches, downloads the results,
and then runs every N minutes to grab any new search results.

Twitter currently doesn't keep search results available for more than a few days, 
which is a shame when you're interested in mesauring the # of results over time,
or if you just don't look at your saved searches that much.

Every 'new' result set is saved to disk for simplicity (no sqlite etc.)

Usage
1. copy config.sample.yml to config.yml and edit
2. ruby archive.rb
3. enjoy your tweets!
